# Hi there, I'm AetherionNode 👋

### ⚛️ Quantum Physics Researcher & Tech Innovator
I am currently focused on bridging the gap between theoretical quantum mechanics and laboratory-scale optical simulations. My work explores the boundaries of wave function collapse, photon injection, and the simulation of extreme gravitational effects through analogue gravity.

---

## 🔬 Current Research Focus
I am the author of two core frameworks currently hosted on TechRxiv:

* **EPIP Framework:** *Laboratory-Scale Framework for Fixed-Energy Photon Injection into Entangled Particle Systems.* * Investigating controlled interactions within entangled systems.
* **TRR Framework:** *Laboratory Simulation of Extreme Photon Redshift via Optical Confinement and Frequency Detuning.*
    * Simulating cosmological and gravitational phenomena using optical confinement.

## 🚀 Startup & Innovation
I am currently developing a startup platform designed to **transform passive audiences into active participants**. I believe that the future of engagement lies in moving beyond the "observer" role into interactive, real-time involvement.
